# API Contract

Base URL: `/api`

This document describes the current backend contract as implemented in code. It is intentionally biased toward runtime truth, not historical behavior.

## Authentication

Runtime behavior:
- The backend writes authenticated cookies for browser flows.
- Login and registration responses still include a `token` field for backward compatibility with existing frontend code.
- Protected endpoints accept the existing JWT bearer token model and browser cookie model.

### POST `/api/register`

Request body:

```json
{
  "fullName": "Alice Example",
  "email": "alice@example.com",
  "password": "StrongPass1",
  "role": "user"
}
```

Response `200`:

```json
{
  "token": "jwt-token",
  "id": 1,
  "fullName": "Alice Example",
  "email": "alice@example.com",
  "role": "user"
}
```

Notes:
- Registration requires prior email verification.
- Password policy is enforced server-side.
- Duplicate email returns `409`.
- Public registration never allows self-assignment to `ADMIN`.

### POST `/api/login`

Request body:

```json
{
  "email": "alice@example.com",
  "password": "StrongPass1"
}
```

Response `200`:

```json
{
  "token": "jwt-token",
  "id": 1,
  "fullName": "Alice Example",
  "email": "alice@example.com",
  "role": "user"
}
```

Failure response:
- `401 Invalid email or password`

### POST `/api/auth/logout`

Response `200`:

```json
{ "logout": true }
```

### POST `/api/auth/password-reset/request`

Request body:

```json
{ "email": "alice@example.com" }
```

Response `200` for both existent and non-existent accounts:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "If an account exists for this email, a password reset link will be sent shortly."
}
```

Notes:
- The reset link base URL comes only from `app.public.base-url`.
- The endpoint is intentionally non-enumerating.

### POST `/api/auth/password-reset/confirm`

Request body:

```json
{
  "token": "reset-token",
  "password": "StrongPass1"
}
```

Response `200`:

```json
{ "reset": true }
```

## Profile

### GET `/api/profile`

Returns the caller's current profile payload, including `displayName`, `email`, `role`, `authProvider`, `canChangePassword`, and `avatarUrl` when present.

### PATCH `/api/profile`

Updates the caller's display name.

### GET `/api/profile/export`

Returns a JSON export of the caller's current user-linked data as stored by this deployment.

Response `200` includes:

```json
{
  "generatedAt": "2026-04-13T21:00:00Z",
  "profile": {
    "id": 11,
    "displayName": "Alice Example",
    "email": "alice@example.com",
    "role": "USER"
  },
  "memberships": [],
  "bookings": [],
  "checkoutSessions": [],
  "transactions": [],
  "chatSessions": [],
  "deletionRequests": []
}
```

Notes:
- this is a runtime-truth export of data directly linked to the authenticated account
- it currently returns JSON, not a file attachment

### POST `/api/profile/session/rotate`

Rotates the authenticated session version and invalidates previously issued tokens for the same account on other devices.

Response `200`:

```json
{
  "rotated": true,
  "token": "jwt-token",
  "authTokenTtlSeconds": 604800,
  "streamTokenTtlSeconds": 86400
}
```

Notes:
- the current browser receives a fresh token and stays signed in
- older auth/stream cookies for the same account become invalid after rotation

### POST `/api/profile/deletion-request`

Creates a deletion request record for manual review. This does **not** directly delete the account.

Request body:

```json
{
  "reason": "Please delete my account and associated personal data."
}
```

Response `202`:

```json
{
  "submitted": true,
  "created": true,
  "message": "Your deletion request has been recorded for manual review.",
  "deletionRequest": {
    "requestId": 7,
    "status": "PENDING",
    "reason": "Please delete my account and associated personal data.",
    "requestedAt": "2026-04-13T21:05:00"
  }
}
```

Notes:
- repeated calls do not create duplicate pending requests for the same account
- deletion-request records are operational markers for later handling, not proof that data has already been erased

## Clubs

### GET `/api/clubs`

Response `200`:

```json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "clubId": 1,
    "name": "Basketball Club",
    "description": "Public club summary",
    "category": "basketball",

## Booking

### POST `/api/timeslots/{timeslotId}/bookings`

Current runtime behavior:
- this endpoint no longer creates a booking directly
- it intentionally returns `402 Payment Required`

Response `402`:

```json
"Create a checkout session first via /api/payments/checkout-sessions"
```

Canonical booking flow:
1. client calls `POST /api/payments/checkout-sessions`

4. payment is completed through virtual confirmation or Stripe
5. backend writes `booking_record`

```

Canonical membership purchase flow:
1. client calls `POST /api/payments/checkout-sessions`

- privacy contact, controller name, retention summary, and processors summary are deployment-configurable public text intended for frontend notices
- session TTL values describe the configured auth and stream cookie lifetimes used by the deployment
